## We'll learn about control flow!

## Simple stuff
x = Inf # we can use Infinity as a number !
        # this makes a Float64
typeof(x)
##
if x < 1
    println("x is smaller than 1")
end
##
if x < 1
    println("x is smaller than 1")
else
    println("x is larger than or equal to 1")
end

##
x = -5
if x < 1
    println("x is smaller than 1")
elseif x < 0
    println("x is smaller than 0")
else
    println("x is larger than or equal to 1")
end

##
if x < 0
    println("x is smaller than 0")
elseif x < 1
    println("x is smaller than 1")
else
    println("x is larger than or equal to 1")
end

##
x = [1.0, 2.0]
if all(x >= 0) && all( x <= 5)
    println("all elements between 0 and 5")
end


##
x = [1.0, 2.0]
if all(x .>= 0) && all(x .<= 5)
    println("all elements between 0 and 5")
end
##
x = 0
y = 5
if x+y > 10 || x < 0
    y = 0
else
    y = 10
end

## That block returned something,  you can "save"
# the result of a comparison
z = if x+y > 10 || x < 0
    y = 0
else
    y = 10
end

## That's it for "if, elseif, else"
